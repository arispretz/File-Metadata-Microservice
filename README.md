# File-Metadata-Microservice
This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "Back End Development and APIs" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using Nodejs and Express. 
In this project, when opening the live view, you can upload a file to obtain precise file metadata.
Tests:
You can submit a form that includes a file upload.
The form file input field has the name attribute set to upfile.
When you submit a file, you receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.
HINT: You can use the multer npm package to handle file uploading.
